  <p>In this generation their are many English language learners who deserve resources to support their journey with learning english as a second language.  Learning a second language can be challenging for any individual, but some children lack the proper resources and  support team to help them learn english. Due to this issue, many English language learners struggle with adapting to the American culture and language. This website will serve as an educational tool to teach ELL students the four essential skills in language learning.  The site will introduce   basic vocabulary words and how to properly apply these terms in a sentence. This resource is an educational tool to help aid and enhance ELL students cognitive, social and technical skills. ESL Fun! serves as an amazing resource to best accommodate and help our children to achieve their educational goals.
