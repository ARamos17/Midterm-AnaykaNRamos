      What is the subject at hand? Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?
 	Many individuals strive for greatness for various reason. To achieve our goals we must be cautious and take small steps in order to reap the hard work we sow. In this generation there is a much higher percentage of individuals who migrated to the United States for a better life. Learning how to speak, read and write in english is one of the most important  and challenging aspect many immigrants struggle with. It has been stated that most immigrants seek for support in order to strive for greatness in the United States.  As an educator, most classes will consist of English language learners who are struggling to adapt to the American culture and to learn English in order to survive. Many ELL students do not have  support at home to help them to continue the process of practicing the four essential skills in language learning. This application will serve as a helpful online tool to educate and provide additional support to help ELL students to master the four essential skills in language learning.  It is important for educators to provide additional support for their students in order for them to learn english. This website will teach ELL students how to read and learn the pronunciation of basic vocabulary words.  This website also serve as an assessment tool in which fun exercises will be applied into the application. The application will  provide ELL  students a fun experience to learn English.   This application can surely help ELL students to master these concept and feel comfortable enough to interact with others.

2. Problem:What is the problem you're trying to solve?
Summarize a problem or difficulty learners often run into when learning that topic.
Problems:
Learning the alphabets and the pronunciation  of  words is one of the difficulties ELL students run into when learning English. Another problem an ELL students may encounter when using an educational application is learning how to navigate the application in english. Educators must be mindful that not all ELL students have prior knowledge on how to use an online tool especially if the application consist of English terms. Guided practice may be necessary when introducing and motivating students to use this application as a tool to learn English. Understanding what is required for them to complete can definitely be consider a challenge for ELL students often run into when learning this topic. The problem that I am trying to solve is to use the website
“ESL FUN!” as a tool to teach ELL students word recognition which will help the students to learn how to read and the pronunciation of the words.

3. Target Audience:
Who is your target audience? Describe in detail
The website ESL FUN! will  teach and accommodate ELL students from grades 1-2. These students are from Spanish speaking counties.
Think of how people/books/technology currently teach that topic or how students often learn the topic and where it falls short.Explain why it falls short using either learning or design theory we have read about so far
	To teach ELL students how to read, write and communicate in english, the application will consist of visual aides. The benefits of using visual aids in a ESL classroom can surely help students to understand and remember concepts more easily.  A short video clip introducing and demonstrating to the students basic english vocabulary words that is used on a daily basis will be implemented in this application. The video will teach students the meaning of each word and how to properly used the words in a sentence.  This will be consider one of the most effective strategies to introduce and help students to gain a clear understanding of the meaning of the vocabulary words and the proper way of how to use the vocabulary word within a sentence.Guided practice and modeling will serve as an important strategy to encourage and help guide the  students when using this application. This application will encourage ELL students to practice the process of pronouncing the words that are introduced to them. Often times when an application is not user friendly it tend to falls short. When an application falls short it can be due to a topic or visual aides that are not friendly or does not interest or encourage students to make connections.

Rationale:
As a general education teacher, I want to teach two of my ELL students the four essential skills in language learning(e.g. how to read, write, speak and listen in English), so that they will be able to communicate with their peers and gain a clear understanding of the lessons. This can strengthen the ELL students cognitive and social skills. This website will be implemented into my lessons. When my students are require to work in heterogeneous groups, I will encourage my students to spend time completing exercises on the website “ESL FUN!”. The website will be consider a requirement for my ELL students to complete. To best accommodate my ELL students I will assign a student who is fluent in English to provide assistance to the ELL students.
