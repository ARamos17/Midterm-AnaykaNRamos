 Reflection
I really enjoyed creating my website. However, I did encounter some challenges during the process of creating my website. One of the challenges that I encountered was creating and connecting my javascript file with my html file. In order to make my experience less confusing and more enjoyable, I decided to create separate html files. For instance, I created a pre-assessment, formative assessment and the index.html file to organize my codes and execute the codes in the correct way. Creating  multiple files has definitely made my experience less confusing and more fulfilling. Overall, I enjoyed creating my website and organizing my thoughts on how I will like to help my ELL students. What I found very interesting  during this experience  is getting my ideas into the skeleton.
